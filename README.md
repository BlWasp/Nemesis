Yeah Kali is good, but did you find everything you were looking for in it ?

This script permits to install some very usefull tools on a Kali machine which are missing by default and yet essential.
It is essentially based on my Hack The Box, certifications, and pentest experiences, and it is non-exhaustive.

At the beginning of the install, the script will ask for `pentest/ctf` : **pentest** will only install the tools and libraries that are usefull in real life engagement, where **ctf** will install everything with stuff for PWN, crypto, and so on.

I will update it everytime I discover new tools.

If you don't want to use some tools, you just have to comment the lines.
Feel free to pull request some new tools !
